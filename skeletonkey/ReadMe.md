This tool is a unified interface for ROMs, emulators and frontends.
SkeletonKey can be used as a GUI to download and configure emulators, deploy frontends, 
launch ROMs, and manage assets & artwork by leveraging internet ROM-repositories, metadata-databases,
 art/video-scrapers and retroArch's netplay capabilities
